## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- Ruby on rails [To build the main Backend services]
- ReactJS [To build the UI and Handle Requests from FE to BE]
- telegram-bot-rb [To handle TelegramBot to Rails integration]
- Docker [To containerize the application]
- Material UI 


## Installation

## Docker

ChopcastBot is very easy to install using Docker containers.

By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within the
Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to
build the image.

```sh
cd chopcastBot
docker-compose up -d
```

This will run and build the chopcastBot image and start all the services.

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in
your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8080
```
